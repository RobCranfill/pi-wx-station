# pi-wx-station
RP2040-based weather station

# Goal
I want to make my own weather station, in large part becuase
I keep one running at the beach, and they keep dying due to 
the inclement weather; I'd like to be able to repair it rather
than buy a new one every few years!

I need an "outside" sensor/transmitter package, and in "inside" receiver/display package.

The "outside" package does not need to be entirely weatherproof; the transmitter itself can be housed in a nearby shed.

The "inside" package needs to have a diplay that can be easily read from across the room in all lighting conditions,
but also not be too intrusive.

There is no WiFi where it will live, so no networking other than the RFM radios is used (if ya can call that networking).


# Implementation
## Hardware
  * Two Adafruit Feather RP2040 microcontrollers with RFM69 Packet Radio (Adafruit part #5712)
  * Adafruit BME280 I2C-based temperature/pressure/humidity sensor
  * VCNL4020 I2C light sensor, Adafruit Product ID 5810
  * Anemometer: Part number RS-FSJT-NPN, from Amazon (or see below)
  * Low priority, not yet implemented:
    * Rain guage
    * Wind vane (for wind direction)
    * Solar sensor
  * Display is problematic
    * For now, using an Adafruit 16x8 1.2" LED Matrix (part #2042)
  * Antenna as needed; so far a quarter-wave wire antenna suffices.

## Software
  * CircuitPython, of course! Latest version, 9.2.4, used for development.
  * Various Adafruit libraries; see 'requirements.txt' for output from 'circup'

## To Do
 * Better fade in/out on display

## HW Notes
| Anemometer | Signal | Feather |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Brown  | VCC    | USB
| Black  | Ground | GND
| Blue   | signal | GPIO 13
| Yellow | N/C    | N/C


## Thoughts
### Alternative parts
 Could be made slightly more cheaply with RP Pico and Adafruit RFM69HCW Transceiver Radio Breakout.

### Display
What sort of display? I want something readable from across the room, but not too distracting.
For now I'm just using two 8x8 LED matrices, which are cheap-ish, readable from afar; not that cool looking tho!


## Reference
 * The Adafruit RFM parts use the so-called ISM "no-license" band at 915MHz. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band

### Anemometer connections
* Is this ame anemomoter? Looks like it:
** https://www.renkeer.com/product/polycarbon-wind-speed-sensor/

When using the pulse-type wind speed sensor, connect the black wire to the power supply and signal ground, the brown wire to the 5-30VDC power supply, the green wire to the pulse signal PNPOUT, and the blue wire to NPN (NPNR) OUT. Thatâ€™s it! Wide voltage power input is 5~30V.
